Where the following formed variants are built for staging purposes:

- stagingInternalDebug
- stagingInternalRelease

And these ones for production purposes:

- productionInternalDebug
- productionInternalRelease
- productionExternalDebug
- productionExternalRelease

**_Sidenote:_** choose productionExternalDebug before executing the app
